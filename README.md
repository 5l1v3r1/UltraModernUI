The Ultra-Modern User Interface is a new interface with a style like the most recent installers for NSIS 3 (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System), the tool that allows programmers to create such installers for Windows. Ultra-Modern UI and NSIS are released under an open source license.

The Ultra-Modern User Interface also features new pages (Confirm, Abort, AlternativeStartMenu, AdditionalTasks, Information, Maintenance, Update, SetupType...). The interface and the graphics can be customized using the provided settings and the new skins system.

Ultra-Modern UI include also another User Interface named Modern UIEx. Modern UIEx is the same User Interface as the original Modern UI style but with the support of the new ultra-modern pages and with a little more options.

Ultra-Modern UI include three NSIS plug-ins:

* [SkinnedControls](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/SkinnedControls_plug-in): a plug-in, natively integrated to Ultra-Modern UI, to skin all buttons and scroll bars of your installer;
* [InstallOptionsEx](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/InstallOptionsEx_plug-in): an extension, natively integrated to Ultra-Modern UI, of the original [InstallOptions](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Docs/InstallOptions/Readme.html) plug-in with more feature to create custom pages;
* [nsArray](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Arrays_in_NSIS): needed by some Ultra-Modern UI features, provide less out-of-the-box arrays and map features.
